## Technologies Utilized

- **HTML5** - is the fifth and current major version of HTML (HyperText Markup Language), the standard coding language used to build and design web pages. Introduced in 2014 by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), HTML5 includes new syntactical features that make it more efficient and powerful compared to earlier versions. It supports multimedia, graphical content, and better semantic capabilities, which allow for clearer code and improved accessibility.

- **CSS3** - stands for Cascading Style Sheets Level 3. It's the latest evolution of the CSS language which defines styles for web pages, including design, layout and variations in display for different devices and screen sizes. CSS3 introduces a range of new features and capabilities aimed at improving the aesthetics and functionality of web content.

- **TypeScript** - is an open-source programming language developed and maintained by Microsoft. It is a superset of JavaScript, adding optional static typing and class-based object-oriented programming to the language.

- **ReactJS** - commonly known as React, is a powerful and widely-used JavaScript library for building user interfaces, particularly single-page applications where a fast and interactive user experience is essential.

- **Next.js** - enables you to create full-stack Web applications by extending the latest React features, and integrating powerful Rust-based JavaScript tooling for the fastest builds.

- **PostgreSQL** - is an advanced, open-source object-relational database system known for its robustness, scalability, and ability to handle large volumes of data. It supports both SQL (relational) and JSON (non-relational) querying.

- **TailwindCSS** - is a utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development. Unlike traditional CSS frameworks which provide predefined components, Tailwind allows developers to style their applications with low-level utility classes directly in the HTML, enabling high customizability and faster styling processes.

## Problem

Prior to development, the Cleaner By Design store lacked certain dynamic features that could optimize user experience and streamline operations. The goal was to address these shortcomings through integration with a more flexible and scalable e-commerce system.

## Challenges

One major challenge was integrating real-time data updates frequently seen in stock levels or prices without performance penalties on user experiences ‚Äì solved by efficiently structuring database calls through advanced SQL scripts paired effectively within our Redux state management flows implemented via hooks provided by Next.js framework itself.

## Solutions

- **Platform Migration**: Migrated existing product listings and customer data from old systems to leverage Medusa‚Äôs headless architecture.
- **Customized Shopping Features**: Developed interactive UI enhancements using React on top of the headless commerce functionality provided by Medusa.
- **Secure Payment Gateway Integration**: Ensured secure transactions with integrated payment options optimized for speed and protection against fraud.
